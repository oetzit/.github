# Ötzit!

*Ötzit!* is a custom purpose game developed by the Institute of Applied Linguistics at Eurac Research for the [Zeit.shift project](https://all4ling.eurac.edu/projects/zeitshift/). Zeit.shift has digitised approximately 500,000 pages of historical Tyrolean newspapers, and sought to promote access to these digital collections through the development of games, activities, as well as an e-learning course.

You can play the game at https://eurac.itch.io/oetzit
